	<h1>Welcome to My Project Page!</h1>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Christopher Schultz, and I am a software engineer currently studying to obtain
		a Master of Science in computer science, which I am scheduled to receive in May of 2023. I
		obtained a Bachelor of Arts in May of 2022, where I double majored in computer science and 
		economics, and double minored in French and history. I currently work as a front-end developer
		for Fordham University, where I apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript edits to departmental websites,
		validate PDFs for accessibilty, and oversee content migrations between the two web-hosting servers.</p>
		<p>A list of some courses that I have taken and passed include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Object Software Design</li>
			<li>Software Engineering</li>
			<li>Video Game Design</li>
			<li>Mobile Application Development</li>
			<li>Macroeconomic Analysis</li>
			<li>Microeconomic Theory</li>
			<li>International Financial Markets</li>
			<li>Financial Market Analysis</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Given my experience as a front-end engineer, I have interest in roles as a front-end or full-stack developer.
		Furthermore, roles as a C++, Java, or C# programmer are of particular interest for me given my experience with
		these languages. Although my experience in the work force is limited, I have a particular desire to work in the video
		game industry, information technology, or within the financial sector. Regardless of the industry, I believe I can
		fully demonstrate my capabilties and capacity in any software development or engineering role.</p>
