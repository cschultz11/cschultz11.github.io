	<p>This is my website, hosted on GitHub, that is used as a pseudo-portfolio for some of my past works, as well as
	demonstrates a rough outline of who I am, what I am interested in, and certain skills that I have. More will be added
	to this site as time progresses and I have more free time to upload new files (and design new pages). In the meantime,
	there is the <a href="https://cschultz11.github.io/about-me/">About Me</a> section, which briefly details my education,
	experience, and what positions I am interest in for employment. On this page there is also some information in order to
	contact me, such as my email, as well as my LinkedIn and GitHub pages.</p>
	<p>There is also a <a href="https://cschultz11.github.io/past-projects/">Past Projects</a> section that includes a handful
	of previous assignments and projects, as well as some files, presentations, and code from said projects. Most of these projects
	were coded in different languages, from C++ to Python to Swift, in order to highlight the various languages I have experience with.
	More projects will be added, including demos of Unity projects and code in other languages, but meanwhile the About Me page offers
	a more in-depth explanation regarding the years of experience that I have with each language.</p>
