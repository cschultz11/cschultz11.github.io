		<h2>Airplane Boarding</h2>
		<p>This project was a year long effort as part of an initiative within my high school that selected
		two promising computer science students to work together to design, develop, and present a simulation
		on a selected topic. The topic we selected was determining and designing an optimal commercial airline boarding
		method. My partner and I used Java for our statistical testing and overall program design, while we opted for C# in Unity
		to develop a VR environment on the Oculus Rift for a demonstration as part of our presentation. This demonstration
		used a large scale 3D modeled plane, passenger representations, and ran a user-selected boarding method in an accelerated time
		to depict the issues and bottlenecks of certain boarding methods.
