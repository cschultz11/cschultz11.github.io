# Sudoku Game
Part of a software engineering course that focused on integration testing, unit testing, and overall coordinating a team. Was a part of the Algorithms sub-group
that designed the respective algorithm calls and functions used by the game engine. The link provided goes to the GitHub repository for our team, which contains
code for each individual. The Algorithms sub-group consisted of myself, Zalen, and Dina, and included some code from our professor, given that our team was missing
one person compared to the opposing Python team.
